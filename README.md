### Never stop learning

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Agilist that believes in a *revolutionary* concept: hire smart people, get out of the way and do everything you can to allow them do great work. Project Management and Agile industry specifically have left a bad taste for many people due to gatekeeping and creating processes for the sake of micromanagement. I'm working on changing that everywhere I go by introducing guardrails vs strictly prescribed and enforced processes.
